Hello! I'm Zhimeng, a first year PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Sahil Singla](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ssingla7/). My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, with a focus on online algorithms and computational geometry.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I was lucky to be advised by [Siu-Wing Cheng](https://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/scheng/) for my final year thesis. I spent an exchange semester at UIUC in Spring 2023, during which I worked with wonderful mentor [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/). Prior to these, I interned at Google during the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023. 

Feel free to reach me at zhimeng [at] gatech [dot] edu.

<sub>I used to go by <strong>Gemma</strong> as an English nickname, chosen because it sounded similar to my Chinese name. But after Google named one of their LLMs <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma">Gemma</a>, people started asking if I was an AI - so I decided to retire it.</sub>
