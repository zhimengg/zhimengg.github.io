Hello! I'm Zhimeng, a final year undergraduate student at HKUST majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, with a focus on computational geometry and data structures. I spent an exchange semester at UIUC in Spring 2023, during which I was lucky to work with wonderful mentor [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/). Currently, I am working on my final year thesis at HKUST, and am fortunate to be advised by [Siu-Wing Cheng](https://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/scheng/). Prior to these, I interned at Google during the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023. 

When not doing CS/Math, I'm probably exploring the world of watercolor painting. Still super new to it, but I love the splash of colors and the surprises that come with each brushstroke. If you're curious, take a peek at my beginner's journey in painting [here](TODO).

Feel free to reach me at zgaoao [at] connect [dot] ust [dot] hk.
