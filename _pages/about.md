Hello! I'm Zhimeng, a final year undergraduate student at HKUST majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests lie in computational geometry and data structures. I spent an exchange semester at UIUC in Spring 2023, during which I was fortunate to work with wonderful mentor Sariel Har-Peled. Currently, I am working on my final year thesis at HKUST, and am fortunate to be advised by Siu-Wing Cheng. Prior to this, I interned at Google during the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023. 

Feel free to reach me at zgaoao [at] connect [dot] ust [dot] hk.
