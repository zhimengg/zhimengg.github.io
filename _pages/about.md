Hello! I'm Zhimeng, a first year PhD student at Gatech. My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, with a focus on online algorithms and computational geometry.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where was fortunate to be advised by [Siu-Wing Cheng](https://www.cse.ust.hk/faculty/scheng/) for my final year thesis on the shortest journal problem in temporal graphs. I spent an exchange semester at UIUC in Spring 2023, during which I was lucky to work with wonderful mentor [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/). Prior to these, I interned at Google during the summers of 2021, 2022, and 2023. 

Feel free to reach me at zhimeng [at] gatech [dot] edu.
